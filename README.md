*This repository contains the analyses reported in: **Exploring the UK Cyber Skills Gap through a mapping of active
job listings to the Cyber Security Body of Knowledge (CyBOK)**.* Accepted to EASE 2023, Emerging Results track.

## Datasets

The two data-sets are available in the data folder:

- *reference.json*. A `json` version of the CyBOK Mapping Reference v1.3.
- *jobs_labelled.csv*. File containing job descriptions with author annotations. 

## Instructions for replication

The original analysis was achieved using Python 3.10.7. The required packages can be installed using:

```py
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The results can then be replicated by running the `eda.ipynb` and `mapping.ipynb` notebooks.
