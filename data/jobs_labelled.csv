You can think of this job as a combination of hardware/systems architect, systems administrator, and DBA. It requires the kind of foresight, reliability, responsiveness, and dedication that you'd expect in someone whose responsibilities include making sure systems run smoothly and without interruption. But the right people for this job will also bring creativity, problem-solving ability, and a knack for developing and communicating architectural proposals to both a technical and non-technical audience.Most of our work is in the healthcare space, particularly with the InterSystems technology stack (Caché, Ensemble, HealthShare and TrakCare). So, if you have experience deploying and administering those products, we welcome you to apply. Candidates who have administered systems for Caché-based healthcare applications like Epic or GE Centricity are also an ideal fit. At the OS level, most of our clients are on Unix, with AIX and various flavors of Linux the most popular choices. If you are a pure Microsoft person, this position is less likely to be a fit for you.  We generally do a good job of keeping travel to a minimum for our employees, and this is especially true for our systems engineering group. We don't do any physical installation of hardware and network infrastructure, so we do all of our work remotely and travel only when there is a strategic need (such as a joint planning/architecture session). That said, there is a growing demand among our customers for off-hours support, and therefore our systems group needs to work together to provide off-hours coverage for certain accounts. Building redundancy in our systems group is a key part of our strategy for work/life balance; in other words, we won't set you up to be the only person who knows a particular customer's systems. There will always be someone else on the team to cover for you when you're taking time off.Though our headquarters is located in Charlestown (Boston), MA, this is a telecommuting position open to anyone who's eligible to work in the UK.

Our approach to design and development is rooted in a fundamental belief that systems succeed or fail based on how well they serve the people who depend upon them. For our clients in the healthcare industry, that includes doctors, nurses, technicians, and administrative staff ... but ultimately, it means patients and their families.At J2 we get a lot of satisfaction out of helping our customers succeed, and we want people with that same commitment to getting the job done right. We’re not afraid to give people the responsibility of working directly with clients, defining project specs, and choosing implementation strategies. Our casual work environment and telecommuting options give our staff a high quality of life to go along with the technical and creative challenges of the work itself.Generally speaking, we are looking to hire full-time, salaried employees.  But if you're a freelancer and want to stay that way, we're open to discussing a contract position as long as we can get a stable, predictable full-time commitment from you.Benefits The ability to telecommute from your home officeMinimal travel on most projectsAggressive employee profit-sharing programVoluntary pension plan with company matching up to 4% of salaryPrivate Medical Insurance paid by J2Income Protection Plan Life CoverLaptop and required software provided by J2Annual ski trip (in the Western US) that will make you wonder how you found this awesome company If you're interested in joining our team, we invite you to submit your resume so we can take a look.

We’re dead set on solving the problem and looking for people to help us achieve our mission. We, at Winnow, believe that food is far too valuable to waste, and that technology can transform the way we produce food. Our team is made of people who all share a passion for food and technology.Winnow was founded in London in 2013 to help the hospitality industry prevent food waste through internet of things tools in the kitchen. We have worked with hundreds of sites and are operating in over 30 countries around the world supported by our offices in London, Dubai, Shanghai and Singapore. We are a rapidly growing company with a strong base of clients who are rolling out our system globally. We have blue-chip customers including Accor Hotels, IKEA, IHG, Marriott, Compass Group and many others.Winnow’s clients on average reduce waste by over 50% by value and sustain savings. Winnow has now worked with hundreds of sites to reduce food waste, including hotels, universities and schools, staff restaurants, event/hospitality kitchens, buffets, pubs, and high street restaurants. Where the system is permanently adopted, pre-consumer waste value is reduced by 50% - 70% over 2 - 12 months, and maintained at these levels, with no detrimental impact to the perceived quality or value of the offer to their customers, and a net saving of staff time due to reduced food preparation and waste handling. This represents a typical improvement of food cost savings of 3% to 8%, commonly a 40%+ increase in profitability for restaurants. Watch our short videos on our YouTube channel to see the system in action.We are passionate about living our values and place them at the centre of everything we do.

Driving behavior is a key factor affecting overall fuel consumption and can increase fuel use by up to 35%. However, current solutions are not cost effective, so logistics operators are constantly looking for new solutions. In addition, logistics operators are under huge sustainability pressure, as Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) are responsible for 16% of the UK's transport emissions but only 5% of the miles travelled. While electric vehicle sales for passenger vehicles are on the rise, the same can't be said for long-haul HGVs due to high initial cost and limited range, making it impractical for logistic purposes. With this problem in mind, we aim to leverage the latest AI techniques to improve the fuel efficiency of diesel trucks today, and increase the range of zero-emission trucks of the future. Our product Hypermile Co-Pilot is a retrofittable AI cruise control for commercial vehicles focused on controlling the speed of the truck efficiently. We have trained the AI algorithms to learn the best techniques for saving fuel: anticipating how traffic flow will change, optimising speed based on the road gradient and maximizing vehicle coasting. As a result, we can reduce diesel consumption by 11% and extend the range of battery-electric vehicles by 15%. The long term vision is to incrementally build higher levels of autonomy with the next milestone being a Level-3 autonomous trucking solution. The company was founded in May 2020 and raised a $1.5M pre-seed round in May 2021 from Y Combinator, Greg Brockman (CTO of OpenAI), Luc Vincent (former Executive VP of Autonomous Driving at Lyft Level 5) and others.
